# Menu AI Generator

The Menu AI Generator is a web application that allows users to generate menus based on a list of foods, their weight, and their weight goals. The application uses the OpenAI API to generate menus that are tailored to the user's needs. The project is built using [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/), React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, tRPC and the OpenAI API.

Once you have the Menu AI Generator up and running, you can start generating menus by following these steps:

The generated menu will include a list of meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as snacks. Each meal will include a list of foods that you can choose from. You can customize the menu by removing or adding foods as needed.
